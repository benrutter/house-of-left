// this function draws an imperfect line
// it takes as arguments:
// x1: x coordinate of 1st point
// y1: y coordinate of 1st point
// x2: x coordinate of 2nd point
// y2: y coordinate of 2nd point
// thickness: thickness of line in pixels
// thicknessWack: how strongly the line thickness varies
// movementWack: how strongly the line veers off
// thicknessScale: how fast the line thickness varies (e.g. 1 would seem random fluctuation, 0.002 would be very smooth)
// movementScale: how fast the line veers off (e.g. 1 would seem almost random points, 0.002 would be very smooth)
// thicknessStart: the perlin noise start point for thickness (use random number if unsure)
// movementStart: the perlin noise start point for movement (use random number if unsure)
